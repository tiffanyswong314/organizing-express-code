# Robust server structure: Organizing Express code

## Instructions
Your task is to extend this API server, which stores "Notes" to enhance the error handling functionality.

It has the folling existing route handlers:
- GET /notes returns an array of notes.
- POST /notes creates a new notes.
- GET /notes/:noteId returns a single note by ID.
- Error handler returns status code 500 by default, or the status property of the error.

## Existing files
You will need to reorganize the folders and files located in src/.

Use the existing data files located in src/data for the responses. Feel free to add or remove data from the files as necessary, but keep the same shape of the data.

## Tasks
You should organize the code to meet the following requirements:
1. Add the ability to update a note.
2. Add the ability to delete a note.
3. In src/notes/notes.controller.js, define the needed route handlers and middleware functions and export create, read, update, delete, and list for use by the router.
4. In src/notes/notes.router.js, define the router.
5. In src/app.js, attach the notes router using app.use("/notes", notesRouter) and have the error handler return a status code 500 by default, or the status property of the error.
